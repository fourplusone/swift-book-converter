Hiding type information is useful at boundaries between a module and code that calls into the module, because the underlying type of the return value can remain private. Unlike returning a value whose type is a protocol type, opaque types preserve type identity—the compiler has access to the type information, but clients of the module don’t.","type":"text"}],"identifier":"doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/OpaqueTypes"},"doc://com.apple.Swift/documentation/Swift/TypeCasting":{"url":"\/documentation\/swift\/typecasting","role":"article","title":"Type Casting","abstract":[{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Type casting"}],"type":"emphasis"},{"type":"text","text":" is a way to check the type of an instance, or to treat that instance as a different superclass or subclass from somewhere else in its own class hierarchy."}],"kind":"article","identifier":"doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/TypeCasting","type":"topic"},"doc://com.apple.Swift/documentation/Swift/ClassesAndStructures":{"role":"article","abstract":[{"type":"emphasis","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Structures"}]},{"text":" and ","type":"text"},{"type":"emphasis","inlineContent":[{"text":"classes","type":"text"}]},{"type":"text","text":" are general-purpose, flexible constructs that become the building blocks of your program’s code.
